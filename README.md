# Stock Market Prediction Project

This project was developed as a graduation requirement for the Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Umm Al-Qura University. It focuses on predicting stock market trends using machine learning techniques.

But before all this why this idea or why this project?
1- We needed something that we can apply on what we learned and learn new things from it.
2- we needed something kinda new to us.
3- We wanted something that looks Magnificent on resume.

## Overview

The Stock Market Prediction Project aims to forecast stock prices by analyzing historical data and applying machine learning models. The project includes both backend and frontend components to provide a complete solution for stock price prediction.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and analysis of historical stock prices
- Implementation of machine learning models for prediction
- Web-based user interface for input and visualization
- Modular code structure for scalability and maintenance

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories and files:

- `backend/` - Contains the backend logic and machine learning models
- `src/` - Source code for data processing and model training
- `Front-end/` - Frontend code for the web interface
- `Equites_Historical_Adjusted_Prices_Report.csv` - Dataset used for training and testing
- `stock_price_model_V4.h5` - Trained machine learning model
- `requirments.txt` - List of required Python packages
- `index.html`, `newdetails.html`, `welcome_page.html` - HTML files for the web interface

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

2. Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirments.txt

3. Make sure the dataset and trained model file are in the correct folders.


## Usage

1. Start the backend server:
python backend/app.py

2. Open index.html in your browser to access the user interface.
